# Steksie
Group Project for the New York Code + Desig Academt in collaboration Marijke van der Veer 

Plants bring a life force into your home and help to keep the air fresh. So what is a better idea than to bring people together and seal bonds of friendship by exchanging pieces of an existing plant that can be used to grow a new plant? Cuttings! That's why we created Steksie, an online platform to exchange cuttings of your favorite plants!
